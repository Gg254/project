        About me </h3>
          <p> Born back in the late 1980, of apoor black family grw up with the
            desire to become rich, not for my own self but to better my family
            and my siblings.</p>
          <p>Grew up facing all the poor-mans problems nwme them all:school fees,
            poor medication, sleeping on an empty stomach, the list can go on and
            on...</p>
          <p>Passed my K.C.P.E joined high school and joined campus afterwards.
            droped out of campus joined Moringa school hoping to better my skills
            to achieve my childish dream; become rich not for my own but for the <thead>
            better of my family.</p>
            <h4> Hobbies and likes</h4>

            <p> Life got a way to classify and define people, based on where you were
              brought up you adopt different hobbies.</p>
            <p>liking to travel wasn't a hobbie but a neccesity since my childish
              dream is to better my family's life, I get to know how better families
              live"</p>
            <p>Swimming wasn't a hobbie till i got to the city, in the village we
              don't swim for luxury. Bridges constructed were for women and children
            men ought to swim there way through the river. </p>
